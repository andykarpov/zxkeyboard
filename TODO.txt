-- scheme drawing using PCAD 

-- PCB tracing using PCAD

-- PCB manufacturing order

-- assembling

-- updating CPLD configuration (mockup design will be different for pin planner)

-- add fearture to MC firmware: CPLD configuration by MC via JTAG pins 
   (I have few projects like that and will adapte one of them)
   Note: it required to connect MC to host (PC) via UART.
